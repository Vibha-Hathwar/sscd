1. Given the list of processes, their burst times and arrival times, Write a C program to implement the FCFS CPU scheduling algorithm. Display the turnaround time & waiting time for each process. Also calculate the average turnaround time and average waiting time.

2. Given the list of processes, their burst times, priority and arrival times, Write a C program to implement the preemptive priority CPU scheduling algorithm. Display the turnaround time & waiting time for each process. Also calculate the average turnaround time and average waiting time.

3. Write a C program to implement producer-consumer problem using semaphores.
